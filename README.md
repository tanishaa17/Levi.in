How we started:-
As we have already work on this project on Frontend part we already have understanding about the flow of our project and we divided the backend of project in six pieces and started working on that.
How it goes:-

First I collected all the data from website for example image,size,price all data from Men and Women section from original website as we have to run the server from backend . So now I will start from Levi’s first page which is Landing or Homepage,

Walson is the one who works on header and footer of the landing page and also the footer of other pages as well he also provided functionality and responsiveness to the header and footer with using media quiries and he is also responsible for making the search option dynamic which was previously static now we can search any product from search box and by clicking search results we can go to products information page as well. And I am the one who works on landing page where I also provided responsiveness and functionality to Landing/Home and as well and I also work upon backend of signup and sign in page where now user can log in by google also and without log in user can’t buy any product and I also made the Help page of Levi.in .

Then Shyam is the one who made the Signup/Sign in page where he used API to fetch the data to provide more functionality to Signup page and every new user have to create account and existing user can log in using his/her data fetched in API. Now here comes our next part which is the product page which is made by Vijendra, He made that page with using backend where all filters are working and he is also responsible for all the complete backend of this project i.e. the all the products that are shown in men and women section are coming from Backend as he build the routes of project and also he help me in signup page backend as well .

Now we will move towards the individual product page which is made by the Shyam with full functionalities and then after this page the add to cart page will come


and this page is made by Tanisha where you can increase or decrease the product quantity and Tanisha also work on the checkout page as well as payment page as well where she also fetched the data from backend and now user can make payment through card,upi,COD as well and now if user done payment through card then user will recieve otp and without correct otp user cant buy product and she also provided options like googlepay , paytm , Phonepe so she done the backend part of Payment page with all Oath and Authentication. Now one part remaining which is store locater which is made by Ajay where if someone want to buy product offline he will get all info about Levi’s store where he can locate store on the map as well and as well as he also somehow help in making the our clown website with his tips.

Difficulties we faced and what we learned :-
So now we have had to work upon backend of the project it get sometime difficult because of merging frontend with backend and how to implement the backend in project is the headache but we know the approach and we successfully implemented and got only learnings from this difficulties.
We all face difficulties while working on this project as it is our first backend project but we finally complete the project successfully
Levi’s clone functionality:-
First user will be on landing page now user have to login with mobile and password or google and if user don’t have account user have to sign up because without sign up user cant buy any product after sign in or log in user can choose the category of which product he want either it women or men and if user want to search any product by particular name he can do that as well or user can just go to product page and select whatever user want and proceed to checkout where user have to enter his/her personal details and select the payment method user want after completing payment user get his product delivered in 2–3 days
